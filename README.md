# dndTower
Simple Dungeons and Dragons 2-ish combat simulator

Uses angular and characters, simple stick man sprites.
Attempted to add some choicea around specializing the random attributes but it isn't working.

Presuming you've got node, you can get things ready with (you may need sudo)
'''
npm update
npm install -g angular grunt bower 
'''

Not needed unless you're generating things:
npm install -g yo generator-angular generator-karma
clone this, I prefer ssh:
git clone git@github.com:DavidLDawes/dndTower.git

but if you don't have keys setup https works:
https://github.com/DavidLDawes/dndTower.git
